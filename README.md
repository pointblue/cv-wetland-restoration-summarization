# Tools to Summarize the Value of Wetland Restorations
## Overview
This repository provides tools for analyzing the prioritization of wetland restorations in California's Central Valley.  The included scripts summarize species distribution models, wetland restoration simulations, and Zonation prioritizations developed by Point Blue Conservation Science for the Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program.  See final report (included in repository; data/final_report.pdf) for details.

The summarization tool is code written in the R programming environment (R Core Team, 2025).  This tool is best used by someone with a working familiarity with R because there is no standalone app or graphical interface.  The scripts must be run via an IDE such as RStudio (recommended), command line, or copy/pasted from a text editor.  Summarization parameters must be edited using RStudio, Notepad++, or similar.  Additionally, some basic troubleshooting issues may arise (e.g., the need to download any missing packages, occasional updates if the version of R is updated, etc.).  

Please contact Nathan Elliott or Matt Reiter at Point Blue Conservation Science with any questions.
