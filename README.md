# Tools to Summarize the Value of Wetland Restorations
## Overview
This repository provides tools for analyzing the prioritization of wetland restorations in California's Central Valley.  The included scripts summarize species distribution models, wetland restoration simulations, and Zonation prioritizations developed by Point Blue Conservation Science for the Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program.  See final report (citation below) for details.

These scripts are best used by someone with a working familiarity with R because some basic troubleshooting issues may arise (e.g., the need to download any missing packages, occasional updates if the version of R is updated, etc.). Point Blue Conservation Science is available to provide support.
